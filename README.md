this project is all about a movie website whereby you can access all the favorite movies you want and you buy a ticket for the movie it also indicates if the tickets are sold out

#### Technologies

I styled using CSS to make it visually appealing and added some size to the fonts and paragraphs.
In Html, I just called the variables and added a voting button functionality that is done with js where
it enables the button to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
most of the functionalities have done it using javascript ,and i did this by using variables ,also used eventlistners
